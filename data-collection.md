# Data Collection

Frequency and Transparency

Determine the frequency of reporting (e.g., annually, semi-annually) and ensure transparency in the reporting process to build stakeholder trust.

Documentation and Record-Keeping

Require detailed documentation and record-keeping for auditing and verification purposes, including data sources, calculation methods, and any assumptions made.

Generation

Standardized Reporting Format

Develop a standardized reporting format that details all relevant information, including operational data of the battery, emission reductions achieved, and methodologies used for calculations.

PECs have unique identification data coded into them, and supplementary data is accessible through the registry. This includes:

* Source of electricity
* Retired REC IDs (if applicable)
* Date when the MWh was produced
* Identity, location (GPS reference), and country of provenance
* Type and capacity of the production facility
* Whether and to what extent the installation has benefited from outside support
* Date when the installation became operational
