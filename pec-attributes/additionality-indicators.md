# Additionality Indicators

Assessing additionality in the renewable energy industry is complex and often debated. PECs will include essential contextual and project-specific information to support stakeholders in evaluating additionality. This transparency allows stakeholders to determine the most important criteria and identify PECs that align with their sustainability values.

## Additionality Information included for all PECs:

* **Project Age/Vintage:** The year the project commenced operations, providing insight into the project's lifecycle and alignment with current technological advancements.
* **Project Contractual Status:** Information on whether the project is under a PPA, repowering contract, or an EAC agreement, indicating long-term commitments to renewable energy generation.
* **Mandated Generation:** Details on whether the project is part of a utility rate base or supported by state-funded life extension programs, reflecting its role in mandated renewable energy contributions.
* **Compliance CFE:** Information on whether the projectâ€™s output is used to satisfy state Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) or Clean Energy Standard (CES) programs, indicating compliance-driven generation.

## &#x20;Additionality Classes of PECs

We have introduced a classification system to clarify and transparently assess the additionality of PECs. This system helps stakeholders identify PECs based on their generation context and contractual agreements, thereby aiding in their environmental impact assessment.

* **Gold:** PECs issued under a long-term PPA, Repower contract, or EAC agreement. These represent high-certainty additionality due to the stability and commitment inherent in long-term contracts.
* **Silver:** PECs issued from projects outside a long-term contract but less than 15 years old, in line with the Green-e standard. These projects are relatively new and likely to contribute significantly to additional renewable energy generation.
* **Bronze:** PECs issued for projects older than 15 years. While still valuable, these projects may not represent the same level of additionality as newer or contract-bound projects.
