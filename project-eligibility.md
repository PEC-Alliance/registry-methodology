# Project Eligibility

## Energy Generation

This methodology covers a broad range of renewable energy sources. The aim is to encompass all forms of renewable energy that can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy system.

This includes but is not limited to:

* wind
* solar
* hydro
* geothermal
* bioenergy
* nuclear

## Energy Carriers

Utility batteries are assessed even though they do not generate power directly. The net emissions of their operation are associated with the power discharge.

* Utility Battery Storage
* Hydrogen Production

## Loads and Power Consumption

This methodology also applies to power consumers as a way to calculate induced emissions. Savings from demand-side management or other energy efficiency upgrades could also be quantified under this methodology.

## Geographic Areas Covered

This methodology is designed to be applicable globally, taking into account the specific characteristics and conditions of different regions. Below is the WattTime zonal emissions coverage map.
